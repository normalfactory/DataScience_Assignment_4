## PyCity School Analysis  
The analysis of the school has identified the following observable trends:

###### 1 School Type Matters 
Those schools that had the school type of charter had a better overall achievement. The overall passting rate for charter schools was 95.2% while district schools was only 73.8% (Figure 9). The top 5 performing schools are all charter schools (Figure 3) while the bottom 5 performing schools are district (Figure 4).

###### 2 Greater Spending does not result in better results
The schools that had the least amount of spending per student, under $600 per student, had the best overall passing rate of 95.1%.  The schools that had the greatest amount of spending per student, between $650 and $657, had the worst overall passting rate of 73.7% (Figure 7).  

###### 3 Large Schools are outperformed by smaller schools
The large schools with a student population of 2000-5000 have the lowest overall performance, 75.4%, when compared to smaller schools. Small schools (<1000) had an overall passing rate of 95.0% while and medium schools (1000-2000) had a rate of 95.2% (Figure 8).
